Summary: Summary of the DjangoCon Europe 2017 Lightning talks pt 2


## You want to maintain an open-source project (@agaevsky)?

It's not easy. It gets easier by getting more maintainers involved, or try to get funding, or transfer the project.

## Rain Forecast (@ewjoachim)

Django has lots of code, leading to less code in your project, until you start to copy code around and stop being DRY.
And miss security patches. Oh. Use `raincoat`. Annotate code with the package, version, module and method you stole it from. It
can then show you what changed since that release! Woo!

## Human - communcation: @idanmelamed

We inherit code.

Say please. Say thank you. Use "I" sentences.

## Beeware: @freakboy3742

Come and sprint on BeeWare to make Python available on all the platforms! Also, bees are nice animals.

## Powerpoint templating with Django:  @xBBTx

Export data to powerpoint. BECAUSE WE CAN^WMUST. `django-bureaucracy`: pluggable engines, knwon template language in
Django (alternatively jinja2), custom tags/filters, rendering picture placeholders, pre-style tables and fill them in
and much more.
