## Concerns

1. Enfocement
2. User experience
3. Performance
4. Convenience

… and the tradeoffs.

## Where to validate data?

1. Frontend:
   - Good UX
   - Works offline
   - Fast
2. Django view
   - Not designed for the task
   - Easy to circumvent
3. Forms/DRF serializers
   - Designed for the task
   - Easy to circumvent accidentally - **will be bypassed at one point or another**
   - Requires discipline
   - Serializers > Forms, but won't include Django Admin
4. Model
   - Designed for the task
   - Doesn't run by default (only called by ModelForm/ModelSerializer)
   - By default only runs partially when called by form
   - Enforce by calling `full_clean()` in `save()`
   - But won't work with
      - `update()`
      - custom save methods
      - `bulk_create()`
      - migrations
   - Redundant with higher-level validation in forms and lower-level database
   - Breaks expectations
5. Database
   - Designed for the task
   - Always enforced
   - Fast, and works with `bulk_create`
   - But: backend specific awfully soon
   - Harder to write
   - Harder to manage

## Field Validation

 - Actual type validation is performed in `to_python`
 - Fields also have a list of validators, in addition to its `default_validators` (which cannot be removed)
 - For more fancy validation, use validator classes with a `__call__()` methods
 - Add `@deconstructible` and `__eq__()` for migrations compatibility
 - Document using partials with those classes
 - Fields have error_messages as a `dict`, in `__init__()`
 - Validation cycle: `Field.clean()`
    - `to_python()`
    - `validate`
    - `run_validators()`
 - Validators can be reusable

## Validation Error

 - Takes `message`, `code` and `params`
 - Message may be an element (string or ValidationError), list of errors (or a ValidationError of lists) or a dict of fields and their errors (or ValidationErrors)
 - Raising an error
    - Wrap a string with `ugettext`
    - Add an error code (e.g. `'invalid'`), for customization
    - Add params dict instead of formatting your message directly, and format message like `'%(something)'`

## Triggering validation

 - `Form.is_valid()`
 - `Form.errors`
 - `Form.full_clean()` - will always reset validation state and re-run, losing state. Override for composite magic.
    - calls `_clean fields()`
    - calls `field.clean()` per field
    - collects all error messages, running through all fields in the process
 - `Form._post_clean()`: Used by ModelForm

## Form validation utils

 - `Form.add_error(self, field, error)` normalizes error input and provides an error class
 - `Form.has_errors(self, field, code)`
 - Raising a validation error is less verbous and more clear, but it's a matter of personal taste
 - Use error codes!

### `Form.errors` (`class ErrorDict`)

 - `as_ul()`
 - `as_text()`
 - `as_data()` - original form
 - `as_json()`

### `Form.errors['some_field']` (`class ErrorList(UserList, list)`)

 - It's a list with magic methods.
 - `as_data`
 - `get_json_data` - the dict
 - `as_json` - the json string

## Model Validation

 - Very similar
 - Trigger it by calling `Model.full_clean()`, catch the errors
 - You can exclude fields
 - Doesn't have a state
 - Directly manipulates model instance instead of using a `clean_data`
 - Validates unique constraints
 - Any field that has failed validation is excluded from uniqueness validation, even and especially composite

## ModelForm validation

 - Adds a `_post_clean()` method
 - Excludes failed fields, fields not on the form
 - Calls `full_clean()` without uniqueness validation
 - Calls `_validate_unique()` separately

## Closing

 - Validate on frontend, if you can afford it
 - Validate on database for critical stuff
 - In between: choose your poison, and stick to it, there is no perfect solution
 - DRF Serializers do a lot of things well, better than either models or forms
 - Loic would like fat models, spanning more than a table where needed
